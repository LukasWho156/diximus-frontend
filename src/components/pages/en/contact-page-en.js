                <p>
                    Hey there! We are Lukas (coding, design and artwork) and Theresa (design, artwork and moral support).
                    We both are big fans of <s>bored</s> board games and developed Diximus together as an online version of one of our
                    favourite games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have questions, feedback or wishes, don't hesitate to contact us via mail:&nbsp;
                    <a href="mailto:diximus.team@gmail.com">diximus.team@gmail.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are an artist yourself and would like to design cards for this game yourself, we would naturally
                    be very happy! Don't be shy to contact us.
